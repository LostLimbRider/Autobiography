## 1. Purpose

This map inventories the existing active documentation and records how the new transactional layer relates to it. It is the migration map required by the organizational implementation directive.

## 2. Scope and Boundary

- This map covers **active** repository material only.
- The `ARCHIVE/` directory is **off-limits by operator directive**: it is not referenced, migrated, evaluated, or modified by this layer. No material was migrated from the archive.
- No existing active document was moved, renamed, or rewritten. The transactional layer is a **parallel structure** that references existing documents in place.

## 3. Existing Active Document Inventory

| Existing Document | Location | Status | Destination in Transactional Layer | Action |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| Handbooks master index | `lost_limb_riders_handbooks/00-START-HERE.md` | Active | `transactional_operations/00-START-HERE/MASTER-INDEX.md` | Referenced; retained unchanged |
| Organization Handbook (consolidated: governance, admin, volunteer, family support, safety & risk, financial procedures, chapter development, position descriptions, bylaws) | `lost_limb_riders_handbooks/01-Organization-Handbook/00-ORGANIZATION-HANDBOOK.md` | Active | Governance, administration, safety, HR references | Referenced; retained unchanged |
| Member Handbook (public) | `lost_limb_riders_handbooks/02-Member-Handbook/00-MEMBER-HANDBOOK.md` | Active | Programs references | Referenced; retained unchanged |
| Program Manuals (6) | `lost_limb_riders_handbooks/03-Program-Manuals/` | Active | `07-PROGRAMS/PRG-REF-001` | Referenced; retained unchanged |
| Forms and Templates (10) | `lost_limb_riders_handbooks/04-Forms-and-Templates/` | Active | `13-FORMS-AND-TEMPLATES/00-FORMS-INDEX.md` | Referenced; retained unchanged |
| Position manuals (42) | `employees/` | Active | `03-HUMAN-RESOURCES/HR-REF-001` | Referenced; retained unchanged |

## 4. Existing Controls Integrated by Reference

The following existing active controls were identified and are either referenced directly or formalized in the new layer without duplicating the source:

| Existing Control (in Organization Handbook) | New Layer Treatment |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Expense approval limits: Department Director $250, Executive Director $1,000, Finance Committee review above $1,000, Board approval above $5,000 | Carried into FIN-CTRL-001 (Approval Matrix) and FIN-PROC-001; flagged for board adoption as the single standard |
| Segregation of duties principles | Formalized in FIN-POL-001 with proportional compensating controls |
| Donation handling (two-person cash counting, prompt recording, restriction tracking) | FIN-POL-002, FIN-PROC-005, FIN-CHK-004 |
| Grant tracking file contents | GRT-REF-001, GRT-PROC-001 |
| Sponsorship agreement elements | FUND-SPON-001 |
| Purchasing principles | FIN-PROC-001 |
| Monthly financial reporting requirements | FIN-PROC-008, FIN-CHK-002 |
| Audit and review requirement | FIN-POL-001 (annual review; independent audit at threshold) |
| Risk management, event safety, emergency response, incident reporting | SFT-POL-001, SFT-SOP-001, SFT-SOP-002, SFT-REG-001 |
| Volunteer handbook principles | VOL-POL-001, VOL-PROC-001 |
| Position description structure | HR-REF-001 |
| Document control requirements | GOV-POL-001, ADM-PROC-001, ADM-PROC-002 |
| Administrative records requirements | GOV-POL-002, REC-MATRIX-001, REC-REF-001 |

## 5. Document Status Definitions

- **Active** — in force; use for current operations.
- **Referenced** — existing active document retained in place; the transactional layer links to it.
- **Superseded** — replaced by a newer document (tracked via headers and ADM-PROC-002).
- **Archived** — historical, no operational authority; the ARCHIVE directory is not part of this layer.

## 6. Known Discrepancies Flagged for Board Resolution

1. **Expense thresholds.** The Organization Handbook financial section sets Department Director $250 / Executive Director $1,000 / Finance Committee above $1,000 / Board above $5,000. FIN-CTRL-001 adopts these as interim **internal control** standards and flags them for formal board adoption. Board adoption is required before reliance.
2. **Segregation feasibility.** The organization’s current size makes full four-way segregation impractical; compensating controls are documented in FIN-POL-001 and must be reviewed as staff grows.

## 7. Relationship of This Layer to Existing Documents

This layer is **authoritative for transactional workflows and controls**. The existing handbooks remain authoritative for governance, program content, and safety substance. Where a conflict appears, it is resolved through ADM-PROC-002 (Change Control) and reported to the Board.

## 8. Review and Maintenance

This map is updated whenever active documentation is added, retired, or relocated. Updates follow ADM-PROC-001.
